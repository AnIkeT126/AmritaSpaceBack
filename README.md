## Introduction

AmritaSpaceBack is a backend server built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/), designed to support the AmritaSpace project. It serves as the backend for managing space-related data and provides RESTful APIs for various functionalities.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Data Management**: CRUD operations for managing space-related data such as satellites, missions, and launches.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain routes.
- **Scalability**: Designed to be scalable and easily extendable to accommodate future requirements.
